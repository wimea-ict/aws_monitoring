Main Program:
	Start
		Load configurations for all stations from the WIMEA-ICT database
		Initialize socket to receive connections on port 10020
	while(true)
		wait for a socket connection from a station
		create a connection handler thread when connection is made
	EndWhile
	Stop

Connection Handler Thread
	Create a large buffer 
	While(true)
		Receive node report
		Add report to the buffer
		If the buffer is full?
			Pass the buffer to a new Data Storing Thread
			Clear the buffer
		Else If node stops sending or times out?
			Pass the buffer to a new Data Storing Thread
			Clear the buffer
			break
		EndIf
	EndWhile
	Destroy Thread

Data Storing Thread
	For each report in the passed buffer
		Check TXT value to identify source station and node
		If no matching station?
		ignore report
		continue
		else
	For each expected parameter in the report from the report
		extract parameter value from the report using the parameter key
		store the parameter value in a nodes_values array
	EndFor
	Store node status information into the node status table
	If any weather parameter is to be calculated?
		Make calculation using values from nodes_status value
	Store sensor values into observationSlip Table
	EndFor
	Destroy thread.
